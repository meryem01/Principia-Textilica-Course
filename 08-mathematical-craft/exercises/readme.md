# Exercises 08

## Rewriting Systems ##

*Software Exercise*

Check out the [Rewriting System Demo](../demos/mathematica/RewritingSystemDemo) I created for you in Mathematica and explore it.
Find your own favourite rule matrix. Document your results!
Can you do this kind of rule based systems without a computer?
If you have black and white paper and a copying machine, go for it!

## Cellular Automata ##

*Mathematica Exercise*

Explore the [CellularAutomata](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/CellularAutomata.html) function of Mathematica.  
What are Starting Conditions, Neighbourhood Sizes, Number of Cell States, and how can you specify them? What o*ther CAs are there besides the regular 1D Cellular Automaton with 3 Neigbors? Also check out the Book “A New Kind of Science”. 

## Weaving Matrices Revisited ##

*Processing Exercise*

Create a Sketch based on the [SimpleMatrix Sketch](../demos/processing/SimpleMatrix) we developed in class.  
Write a function that can display a complete draft.

Specify treading and threading sequence and tie-up matrix in code, and display it on screen.  
Try to write or steal functions to do matrix multiplication and matrix inversion operations needed to create the drawdown from the Weaving Draft Demo, so you can complete the draft!


## Generative Craft ##

*Pen and Paper Exercise*

Pick your favourite textile technique.  
Think about ways in which you could use Cellular Automata, Spacefilling Curves or other generative mechanisms to create interesting patterns!
