## Weaving Matrices ###

*Processing Exercise*

1. Create a function that turns a treadling / threading sequence into a binary matrix
2. Write a *Processing* sketch that draws a weaving draft from the matrices for treading, threading and tie-up
3. Add a function that computes the weave from the three previous matrices, and displays it.

Having a look at the *Mathematica* files + matrix multiplication for inspiration.


## Code Crafting ##

*Pen and Paper Exercise*

Take a textile technology such as weaving, knitting, braiding and think about how you could use this to encode a text message. You are encouraged to take inspiration from binary code + morse code and other coding schemes.
