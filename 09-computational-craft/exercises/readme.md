## Pa++ern ##

*Software Exercise*

Check out the [Pa++ern](http://www.rzm-dev.com/pattern/) Website. The *Pa++ern* Language is explained under **how to play**.  
If you send a tweet to with your *Pa++ern* Program to [_pt](http://twitter.com/_pt),
it should appear under **list of programs**.  
You can then click it you could order a tshirt with the pattern embroidered onto it.  
Use the **[standalone builder](http://www.rzm-dev.com/pattern/standaloneBuilder.html)** to learn how to use the *Pa++ern* language and create a complex patterns with it.

---

**Step 1)**
Create a basic repeat using primitive stitches, translation and rotation commands.
    
**Step 2)** Now use loop and translation commands, to create a rectangular grid of those units. You may also use the scale commands, to create a circular grid.

**Step 3)** Post both the code and the image to your github repo.


## Code Stitching ##

*Processing Excercise*

You can find a *Processing* Version of the *Pa++ern* Generator [here](../demos/processing/CodeStitching).  
It takes a *Pa++ern* program and parses it character by character.
Can you extend the program to create custom commands for custom stitches?  

Currently the list of elementary stitches just comprises `+`, `-`, `|`, `/` and `o`.  
Add commands to stitch the initials of your name.

Example: If you are John Doe, add commands `J` and `D` to create stitches that look like those letters.


## Code Crafting ##

*Pen and Paper Exercise*

Think of how you can use a language similar to the *Pa++ern* language to create patterns in your favourite textile technique. (Braiding, weaving, knitting, origami ... you name it).  
What are the elementary commands? What operation does each of the commands encode?  
*Write a little program in your language, and execute it on paper and in material!*

- Make use of loops to create a concise program!  
- Can you write the same program without using loops?  
- Which version do you prefer? Why?
